# Installation Script

I built this to make it easier to set up new computers.  Thanks to the following repos for giving me the idea:
* https://github.com/zellwk/dotfiles
* https://github.com/caseyWebb/laptop

Still have a few things I want to do to improve this:
* Check to see if the App is already installed.  If so skip the cask install.  
* Clean up the files.

You need to clone the directory:  
git clone https://github.com/aakar/laptopsetup.git ~/.laptopsetup
OR
git clone git@github.com:aakar/laptopsetup.git ~/.laptopsetup 

Then chmod 755 the setup.sh file and run ./setup
